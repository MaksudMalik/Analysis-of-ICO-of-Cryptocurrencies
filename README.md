# Analysis-of-ICO-of-Cryptocurrencies
### This project was part of Jovian's Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas course. Here I tried to visualize data and draw some conclusions from the collected dataset. There were many missing data and also a lot of gibberish/irrelevant values, the analysis could have been a lot better with a complete dataset.
